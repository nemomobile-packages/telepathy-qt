 *
 * \brief The AbstractClient class represents a Telepathy client.
 *
 * Clients are programs used to process channels, approving, handling or
 * observing them. User interface processes are the obvious example of clients,
 * but they can provide other functionality, such as address-book
 * synchronization, message logging, etc.
 *
 * Each client is either an observer, an approver, a handler, or some
 * combination of these.
 *
 * Clients can be activatable services (those with a D-Bus .service file)
 * so that they can run in response to channel creation, or non-activatable
 * services (those that do not register a D-Bus .service file
 * for their well-known name, but do request it at runtime) so
 * that they can process channels, but only if they are already
 * running - for instance, a full-screen media center application might do this.
 *
 * As an optimization, service-activatable clients should install a file
 * $XDG_DATA_DIRS/telepathy/clients/clientname.client containing a cached version
 * of their immutable properties. The syntax of these files is documented in the <a
 * href="http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/spec/org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.html">
 * Telepathy specification</a>.
 *
 * Non-activatable clients may install a .client file, but there's not much
 * point in them doing so.
 *
 * This is a base class and should not be used directly, use the
 * specialized classes AbstractClientObserver, AbstractClientApprover and
 * AbstractClientHandler instead.
 *
 * If the same process wants to be either a mix of observer, approver and
 * handler, or a combination of those it can multiple inherit the specialized
 * abstract classes.
 *

 *
 * \brief The AbstractClientObserver class represents a Telepathy observer.
 *
 * Observers are clients that monitor the creation of new channels.
 * This functionality can be used for things like message logging.
 *
 * Observers should not modify the state of a channel except via user
 * interaction.
 *
 * Observers must not carry out actions that exactly one process must take
 * responsibility for (e.g. acknowledging text messages, or carrying out
 * the actual file transfer), since arbitrarily many observers can be
 * activated for each channel. The handler is responsible for such tasks.
 *
 * Handlers may, of course, delegate responsibility for these tasks to other
 * clients (including those run as observers), but this must be done
 * explicitly via a request from the handler to the observer.
 *
 * Whenever a collection of new channels is signalled, the channel dispatcher
 * will notify all running or activatable observers whose filter indicates that
 * they are interested in some of the channels.
 *
 * Observers are activated for all channels in which they have registered an
 * interest - incoming, outgoing or automatically created - although of course
 * the filter property can be set to filter specific channels.
 *
 * To become an observer one should inherit AbstractClientObserver and
 * implement the pure virtual observeChannels() method. After that the object
 * representing the observer must be registered using
 * ClientRegistrar::registerClient().
 *
 * When new channels in which the observer has registered an interest are
 * announced, the method observeChannels() is invoked. All observers are
 * notified simultaneously.

/**
 * \class AbstractClientApprover
 * \ingroup clientclient
 * \headerfile TelepathyQt/abstract-client.h <TelepathyQt/AbstractClientApprover>
 *
 * \brief The AbstractClientApprover class represents a Telepathy approver.
 *
 * Approvers are clients that notify the user that new channels have been
 * created, and allow the user to accept or reject those channels.
 *
 * Approvers can also select which channel handler will be used for the channel,
 * for instance by offering the user a list of possible handlers rather than
 * just an accept/reject choice. However, the channel dispatcher must be able to
 * prioritize possible handlers on its own using some reasonable heuristic,
 * probably based on user configuration.
 *
 * It is possible (and useful) to have an approver and a channel handler in the
 * same process; this is particularly useful if a channel handler wants to claim
 * responsibility for particular channels itself.
 *
 * All approvers are notified simultaneously. For instance, in a desktop system,
 * there might be one approver that displays a notification-area icon, one that
 * is part of a contact list window and highlights contacts there, and one that
 * is part of a full-screen media player.
 *
 * Any approver can approve the handling of a channel dispatch operation with a
 * particular channel handler by calling the
 * ChannelDispatchOperation::handleWith() method. Approvers can also attempt to
 * claim channels by calling ChannelDispatchOperation::claim(). If this
 * succeeds, the approver may handle the channels itself (if it is also a
 * handler), or close the channels in order to reject them.
 *
 * Approvers wishing to reject channels should call the
 * ChannelDispatchOperation::claim() method, then (if it succeeds) close the
 * channels in any way they see fit.
 *
 * The first approver to reply gets its decision acted on; any other approvers
 * that reply at approximately the same time will get an error, indicating that
 * the channel has already been dealt with.
 *
 * Approvers should usually prompt the user and ask for confirmation, rather
 * than dispatching the channel to a handler straight away.
 *
 * To become an approver one should inherit AbstractClientApprover and
 * implement the pure virtual addDispatchOperation() method. After that the
 * object representing the approver must be registered using
 * ClientRegistrar::registerClient().
 *
 * When new channels in which the approver has registered an interest are
 * ready to be dispatched, the method addDispatchOperation() is invoked.
 * The new channels are represented by a ChannelDispatchOperation object, which
 * is passed to the addDispatchOperation() method.
 * All approvers are notified simultaneously.

 * For its entire lifetime, each channel on a connection known to the channel
 * dispatcher is either being processed by the channel dispatcher, or being
