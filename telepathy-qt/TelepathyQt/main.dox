 *
 * This is the list of examples in Telepathy-Qt's examples directory.
 * The examples demonstrate Telepathy-Qt features in small, self-contained
 * programs. They are not all designed to be impressive when you run them,
 * but their source code is carefully written to show good Telepathy-Qt
 * programming practices.
