 *
 * \brief The GenericCapabilityFilter class provides a generic filter object to
 * be used to filter objects by capabilities.
 *
 * The objects used in conjunction with this filter must implement a method
 * called capabilities() returning a CapabilitiesBase (or a subclass of it)
 * instance.
 * Specialized classes such as AccountCapabilityFilter are also provided and
 * should be used where appropriate.
